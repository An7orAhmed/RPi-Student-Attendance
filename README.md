# RPi Student Attendance

## Description

This project is a **Raspberry Pi Student Attendance** system. It utilizes fingerprint recognition for efficient and automated attendance tracking.  The system is designed for real-time marking, and can potentially send SMS notifications.  Visual and auditory feedback are provided via LEDs and a buzzer.  While the provided example code is in Python, the project can incorporate components in **C/C++/Arduino/Proton Basic** as indicated in the project context. This system streamlines attendance management for educational institutions.

## Project Components (Based on Python Code)

- **Raspberry Pi:**  Main controller for the attendance system.
- **Fingerprint Sensor:** For student identification via fingerprint scanning (e.g., Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor).
- **LEDs:**  Visual indicators for system status (Red, Green, Blue LEDs are used in example code).
- **Buzzer:**  Auditory feedback for events and alerts.
- **GSM Module (SIM800):** Optional module for sending SMS notifications (based on code, for features like attendance alerts).

## Provisional Pin Map (Based on Code Analysis)

**Note:** *This pin map is derived from the provided Python scripts and is for reference only. Actual pin assignments may need adjustments during hardware setup and testing. Refer to your hardware documentation for accurate pin configurations.*
